# P3 Theme for Visual Studio Code

A minimal dark theme for Visual Studio Code inspired by the amber colors seen on
the [monochrome monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_monitor) of
the 80s.

It follows few simple principles[^1]:

- Reduce visual noise by using a limited color palette.
- Recognize the importance of code comments by making them more prominent.
- More emphasis on identifiers and literals, less on language keywords.
- Everything else should fade into the background.
